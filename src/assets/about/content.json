Presently, we are working on puzzles and stories related to maths and computers. In future, we'd love to delve into the world of art, music and photography as well."

            "answer" : "So here's the thing ‚Ä¶ we have taken inspiration from The Economist's playbook. I read a really cool article about it somewhere... let me search for it and send it to you. Overall, idea is that we want the content presented here to be known for itself and not for it's association with the people creating them. That's why we haven't explicitly provided credentials and use the collective \"we\". If you really want to know more about us, you are always welcome to reach out.",

            "question" : "Why such a weird name \"ReinventingWheel\" ? Isn't reinventing the wheel supposed to be a bad thing ?",
            "answer" : "Well ‚Ä¶ Yes and No ‚Ä¶ the phrase essentially means wasting time by inventing something that already exists. In industrial context, it's bad because it is inefficient ... it's basically wasting time. However in educational context, it's not. It actually represents our key motive here. We are not trying to invent anything new. We are a curious bunch who want to learn about the inner workings of things which already exist in this world."

            "answer" : "All of us already have day jobs and this is more for our intellectual fulfillment rather than monetary gain. All the content is free and code is open source ... You can checkout our github repository. Additionally we promise to not put advertisements as well üòé"
