    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>I think the best way to start would be an XKCD comic strip on the same topic</p>

        Computers were designed to be deterministic in nature. A computer should always give us same answer to any particular question no matter how many times we ask it. 1 + 1 should always be 2 and nothing else. This is quite an important and non negotiable prerequisite for us to rely on computers.

We'll have the philosophical discussions on this topic some other day ...</i>">With time, they have become an integral part of our lives.</a>

        They do a lot of heavy lifting in management of our lives. We let them fly aeroplanes, manage our bank accounts, help with communications, and a thousand other things. I don't think we trust any other human being as much as we trust the computers. None of which would have been possible if computers were unpredictable. This sheer predictibility of a computer's behaviour gives them all this power.

        Now few days ago, when I asked the computer to give me a sequence of random numbers, it did ... it actually did and the results really seemed random. I checked multiple times by asking it the same question again and again... guess what ... the answer was different every time.

        <a href="#" @click.stop.prevent data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-original-title="<i>Well my mind gets blown by a lot of things ... but still...</i>">My mind was blown. ðŸ˜± </a>

        In my head, this was analogous to opening the door of my refrigerator to see something other than the leftovers I shoved in yesterday.

    </p>
    <p>
        With this new found curiosity, I started researching a bit more about this problem and turns out that a lot of people have worked very hard over the years so that we can make computers churn out random number ( or seemingly random numbers ... will delve into it shortly )

    <h4>Story about the first Random Number Generator</h4>

    <p>
        People used to generate random number much before computers were invented. There was this dude somewhere who filled pages and pages by rolling dice. Internet is divided on the question - "Are human beings good at generating random number ?" . There's a numberphile video on youtube which says probably not, while some folks in quora belive that we are better than we think. I'll try and do experiments on the topic in future ... But for now, I'll fast forward to the first computerised implementation of random number generators
