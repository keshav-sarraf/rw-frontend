    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>
        You'd be given a block of text and a corresponding target to find something in it. Your task is to to provide a regular expression that extracts the information that we are looking for. Also, the laptop is rigged to self destruct after sometime, so be cautious of the time. Good luck and godspeed üèÅ.

    <h4>Lesson</h4>

    <p>
        A regular expression (regex) is just a pattern of characters that we use to search within a given text. For example, the regular expression <code>the</code> means: the letter <code>t</code>, followed by the letter <code>h</code>, followed by the letter <code>e</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>"the" => The fat cat sat on <mark>the</mark> mat.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, regexes are normally case-sensitive so the regular expression <code>The</code> would <b>not</b> match the string <code>the</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>"The" => <mark>The</mark> fat cat sat on the mat.</code>
    </p>
