        If you already know what regular expressions are, feel free to skip ahead. For those who are still reading this, in simple terms: regular expressions are a simple programming language used for searching text within a document. As an example- If you are looking for all the phone numbers/email ids in a document, then Ctrl/Cmd + F won't help you. In such situations, regular expressions are the tool to use.

        It doesn't matter if you just want to get your feet wet or are a pro looking to brush up, play along and enjoy the game where a nefarious entity tries to bring the internet down and you save the day by using your regex skills.

        If you are not familiar with RegEx at all then don't worry, each level is preceded by a lesson to help you. And trust me when I say this, you don't have to memorize all the concepts at all. Once you are aware of the possibilities, then you can always look stuff up over the internet. Even in the game, if you are unsure, just look at the hints at the bottom or pause the game and re-review the lesson.

        PS: More than 90% of the lessons are inspired from <a href="https://twitter.com/ziishaned">@ziishaned</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex">awesome github post</a>
