        If you already know what regular expressions are, feel free to skip ahead. For those who are still reading this, in simple terms: regular expressions are a supercharged version of finding something within text documents. As an example- In a document, if you are looking for words which begin in capital letters and are preceeded by a period, then regular expressions is the tool to use.
